\subsection{Pipeline}
\label{Pipe}
A workflow is a set of computational methods with chain dependencies similar to a graph without loops, e.g. DAG. Figure XX shows an example workflow, where tile based descriptor generation is deployed. As datasize is not within RAM limitations in general, we adopted a divide and conquer strategy, where we split the data into smaller patches and distribute over both local and cluster environments. 

It works as a diagnostic tool, that screen a computational workflow and reports the status of each tile/process. It also
